# Super-Summer-Seating
Seating for Super Summer  
Middle = 14 chairs  
Sides = 6 chairs  

Create a .txt file with the numbers for the group sizes split onto individual lines.

Run the program, open the .txt file, and the groups will be split into 3 columns representing the 3 sections in the chapel.
